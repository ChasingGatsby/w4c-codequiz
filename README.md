# Week 4 Challenge: Code Quiz
## Description
For this week's homework challenge, we were asked to design a website executing a quiz for javascript. The intended functionality included: a way to record scores, displaying those recorded scores from highest to lowest, and implementing a dynamic timer that ticked faster upon missing questions.
This ended up being a difficult, but overall fun project. With a lot of my hangups with HTML and CSS pretty much cleared up in the past few weeks, most of the work was obviously left to working out the JavaScript.
However, for my approach, I simply put the bulk of my intend content in the HTML and essentially turned my JavaScript into a terminal switcher, having it turn sections on/off via setAttribute(), depending on the context and the button the user was clicking.
There are some things I wish to include/work on at some point: an indicator of whether a question was answered correctly/incorrectly, more nuanced scoring system, cleaner variable management (especially this one).
While I know there are other ways to achieve this result, I think that was the most important part of this project: since this was the first project requiring me to use all three basic languages (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), it was also a way for me to really start figuring out my style of coding.
